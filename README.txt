# Update

This was forked and modified by David Hogue with some small changes to:

1. break posts on words rather than splitting words
2. add the window frame so the window can be moved
3. update chromium and make the app a little smaller

# Original Readme

Welcome to an early version of my minimal FFXIV RP Toolbox standalone. It probably has a lot of bugs and issues. I know it's not super pretty or functional. I might add to it with time, especially if I receive some donations, which you can send me here - https://ko-fi.com/A3184ZHB

TO RUN: Open the xivdash application. And that's it, no installer necessary.

As of now, this will only work on Windows platforms but it should be pretty easy to build it for Mac OS and/or Linux if there's interest. Contact me on Discord @ DasRegal#2198 if you'd like to leave feedback.
